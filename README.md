# Vachnamrut_Visulization
 This is my Second year internship project in data visualization at Milestone Technochrat Pvt Ltd under guidance of Mr. Ravi Patel (CTO of MSTC). In this some concepts of data analysis is used for visualize some important data of Swaminarayan Hindu scripture "The Vachanamurt".

## Brief_Abstract
In today’s era data has become more and more important but it is also important how we see that data means how we visualize that data in our mind. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner. So most data analysts use data visualization techniques to represent data and convey the concept of data. The project entitled as “Vachanamrut Visualization” which is based on extracting important information from one of holy Swaminarayan scripture and visualize it by different visualization methods in R tool. Vachanamrut contains discourses of Bhagwan Swaminarayan and his conversation with saints and devotees. Vachanamrut provides spiritual guidance on how to remain happy in this life and beyond, how to attain complete progress in life, how to overcome even the most difficult situations. Vachanamrut is a unique work of prose in the Gujarati language. In Vachanamrut Bhagwan Swaminarayan imparted his wisdom in a clear and unique manner in a question and answer dialogue. Data in Vachanamrut is in a semi-structured format. In this project work we extract some important information from Vachanamrut like place where it disclosed, date, questions asked by different saints, length of particular Vachanamruts, important words used by Bhagwan Swaminarayan, Gap between two Vachanamruts, number of Vachanamrut in different seasons, months, years, etc. and visualize it by different charts. Complete visualization has been done using C#, SQLite, R, R Shiny.
